# Hostizi CloudPanel Branding

This script replaces CloudPanel's default branding (logo, favicon, etc.) with **HOSTIZI** branding after CloudPanel is installed on a VPS.  
Just run one command, and all branding will be updated from this GitHub repository.

## üöÄ Usage

1. SSH into your VPS:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Restarting CloudPanel

If CloudPanel doesn‚Äôt restart automatically, you can try manually restarting Nginx:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Or if you know the CloudPanel service name, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart cloudpanel.service
```

If `cloudpanel.service` is not found, use this to find the correct name:

```bash
systemctl list-units --type=service --all | grep cloudpanel
```

## ü§ù License
